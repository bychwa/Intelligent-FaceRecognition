## Intelligent-FaceRecognition
In this project, I am trying to use Artificial intelligence to train and understand someones face patterns and make sure that the program always remember someones face.

1. Initially, I am using normal haarcascade to detect face and draw a rectangle when it finds a face.
2. I will add feature to train the application to detect someones face and save those data for future reference.
3. I will add feature to mark someones name so that when, opencv scans already detected person, it should display someones name.
4. After all of the above, I will try to implement authentication system based on face. Like system saying hello "Name" after scanning.
